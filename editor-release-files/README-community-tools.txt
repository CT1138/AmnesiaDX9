<---MISC INFO--->

WARNING: Changing the grid settings in the Model Editor causes a crash. 
It's a bug which was present in the source code and is being currently examined.

The install contains modded config files.
They add new area and entity types, so that the editors can be used with MFP.
They don't clash with TDD, but don't expect these features to work in-game if you put them in a map:
- Colorgrading area
- Infection area
- New entities with custom types, such as PhoneBox

The editors come with the dark theme by default now.
If you prefer the original light theme, unpack the gui-original-light-theme.rar file and overwrite the existing gui folder.
